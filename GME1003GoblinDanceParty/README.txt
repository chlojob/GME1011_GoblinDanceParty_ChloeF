1.) I completed all 6 steps. Including the bonus star sprite change for step 6.

2.) I commit/pushed my changes after each step completed.

3.) I executed 7 commits (after this upcoming push including Step 6 and this readme)

4.) An issue I had was my own fault, not particularly with GitHub. I did the entire project one time over and realized my comments weren't sufficient. These can't be changed without doing another push so I did it over again rather than having 7 pushes in 2 minutes from copying and pasting.

5.) I used AI to help with the colour selection and the code to stretch the background to the window size. Also helped change some parameters in Goblin.cs to help with the new and improved sprite sheet.
